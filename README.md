This project is for judging the https://hackaday.io/contest/203248-one-hertz-challenge

Copy your CSV file into a 'dat' subdirectory. Then this file will print out the list of projects with their links to hackaday.io.

If you have questions try to find me in #writers-room.

The idea with this code is to print out a table of competition submissions which you can ctrl+click on to open in tabs,
then you can organize your browser tabs based on awesomeness. Once you have the 57 entries in order
you can update the spreadsheet with your rankings.
